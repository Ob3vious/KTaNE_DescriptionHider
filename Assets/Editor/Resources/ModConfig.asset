  description: 'With the rise of mission settings, some mission descriptions have
    become a little less attractive. With this utility mod, mission makers can now
    hide these mission settings and other things from the player (if they have this
    mod installed).

    - Use <hidden> to hide that line and all text after.

    - Use <hiddensingle> to hide that line and the line following it.'
